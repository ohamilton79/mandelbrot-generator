# mandelbrot-generator
This Python script uses the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries to draw the Mandlebrot set, providing options to do so with different magnifications and offsets in the x and y directions. Although drawn as a square image with a fixed aspect ratio, the resolution of the image can be modfiied by the 'step' variable in the program, measured in pixels. The resulting image has a final name corresponding to the values used to generate it (the x and y offsets, as well as the magnification).
