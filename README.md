# mandelbrot-generator
This Python script uses the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries to draw the Mandlebrot set. The resulting image has a final name corresponding to the values used to generate it (the x and y offsets, as well as the magnification)

# Key features:
Provides options to create images with different magnifications and offsets in the x and y directions.

Although drawn as a square image with a fixed aspect ratio, the resolution of the image can be modified with the 'step' variable in the program, measured in pixels. 

You can use the grayscale flag to choose between a colour or black and white image.
